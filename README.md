# RiskIntel: Customer Risk Classification

## Overview
RiskIntel is a machine learning project designed to predict whether a customer is "risky" or "not risky" based on various features. This model helps businesses assess customer risk and make informed decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training is **Customer_Risky_Not_Risky.csv**, which contains the following columns:
- **label**: Target variable (1 for risky, 0 for not risky)
- **id**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **fea_1 to fea_11**: Various features influencing risk assessment

## Objectives
- Develop a predictive model to classify customer risk.
- Utilize feature engineering and machine learning techniques.
- Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
